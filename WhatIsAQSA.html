  <p class="intro"> A "QSA" club stands for "Queer-Stright Alliance." It is a club for people that are a part of the LGBTQIA community and people that are allies and care about the cause can meet together in a safe environment. Some schools may call their club other similar names, such as a "GSA" for "Gay-Straight Alliance." These clubs are a safe place for LGBTQIA students and allies to be able to have a community together.</p>
